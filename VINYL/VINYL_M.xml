**What it does**
VINYL is a software designed to assist in variant prioritization in medium-large cohort of patients. The program computes an aggregate score, which is based on an extensive collection of publicly available annoations, in order to identify/prioritize variants that are likely to be pathogenic or have a clinical significance. In order to derive an optimal cut off score for the variants, VINYL uses a strategy based on "survival analysis", where the pathogenicity score distribution of the affected individuals is compared with a matched cohort of unaffected individuals.
To facilitate the usage of the software, VINYL is provided in the form of a public Galaxy instance, based on the Laniakea suite. To ensure the maximum level of security, VINYL uses Encrypted data volumes for the storage of the data.

**Important Usage Note**
This wrapper provides the module of VINYL that perform score calculation. See the "survival" and the "optimizer" utilities for the delineation of the cut-off score and the  optimization of the score components value
A complete workflow that automates the exectuion of VINYL is avaiable at XXX
